#BITFY WEBSCRAPER

Its just a webscraper i made to track news about cryptocurrency. I know i could use an API from google or something like that,
but i thought it would be fun if i could do my own. I could use only python wich is the language i am most used to,
but i wanted to learn something new, so i also used NodeJs.
